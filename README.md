# Novel-StyleGAN-Inversion-Papers
Share some intersting paper about StyleGAN, especially StyleGAN Inversion.

## The pioneer in StyleGAN Inversion.
1. [Image2StyleGAN: How to Embed Images Into the StyleGAN Latent Space?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03189.pdf)
2. StyleGAN Encoder. [[code1](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder)] [[code2](https://github.com/pbaylies/stylegan-encoder)]

Image2StyleGAN is the first paper in StyleGAN inversion. In this work, they conduct some interesting experiments which is meaningful to the future works. StyleGAN Encoder is another pioneer work, which take the results of a nerual network as initial point of the next optimization produre. StyleGAN Encoder has two representive repos, in which `code1` is ealier and `code2` has better inversion effect. 


## How to design the encoder? These papers give their solutions.
1. [Designing an Encoder for StyleGAN Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02766.pdf).
2. [Encoding in style: a stylegan encoder for image-to-image translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00951.pdf).
